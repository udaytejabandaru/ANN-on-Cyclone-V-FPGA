# Handwritten Number Detection through ANN on FPGA

This project implements a handwritten digit classifier using an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) mapped onto an Intel DE1-SoC FPGA board. It demonstrates an end-to-end hardware/software co-design approach, combining FPGA-based acceleration with ARM processor orchestration.

## Overview

- Built an ANN with the MNIST dataset for digit recognition (0â€“9).
- Input layer: 784 neurons (28x28 pixels).
- Hidden layer: 16 neurons with ReLU activation.
- Output layer: 10 neurons representing digit classes.
- Achieved more than 94% accuracy after training.

## Hardware and Tools

- Target board: Intel DE1-SoC FPGA
- Design software: Intel Quartus Prime
- High-Level Synthesis (HLS) compiler to convert C code into Verilog RTL
- ARM-based Hard Processor System (HPS) running Linux for software control
- AXI memory-mapped interface for communication between HPS and FPGA fabric

## Implementation Details

- ANN model first trained in TensorFlow and Keras.
- Trained weights and biases converted from 32-bit floating point to fixed-point representation.
- Network layers mapped into modular C functions, then synthesized to Verilog RTL.
- Integrated hardware IP with HPS software using AXI interconnect.
- End-to-end system:  
  1. Select MNIST test image in HPS.  
  2. Send pixel data to FPGA.  
  3. FPGA computes classification.  
  4. FPGA returns predicted class index.  
  5. HPS decodes and displays result.
